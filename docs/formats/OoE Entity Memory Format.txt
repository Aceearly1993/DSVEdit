01A,2: Frame counter.
030,4: X pos.
034,4: Y pos.
038,4: Z pos.
03C,4: X velocity.
040,4: Y velocity.
048,4: X acceleration.
04C,4: Y acceleration (gravity).
06C,2: Affects the entity's graphics.
  This is an index in list 0211E0C0.
074,4: Bitfield.
  Bit 0x04: For skeletally animated enemies, this bit must be set or the parts won't be rotated at all.

0A2,2: Sprite y offset relative to the entity's position.
0A4,1: Controls the iframes this entity should give.
  This is an index in list 020B5C28 - a list of different iframes values. Each entry is 1 byte long.
  This value is only read when the entity is initialized, changing it after the entity already exists has no effect.
0A6,1: Hitbox bitfield.
  Bits:
  0x1: Whether this entity's hitboxes are active or not.

0B4,4: Bitfield of weaknesses.
0B8,2: ? something related to glyph union?
0C0,2: Magical defense.
0C8,4: On-hurt-player callback.
  This function pointer is called when the entity collides with the player.
