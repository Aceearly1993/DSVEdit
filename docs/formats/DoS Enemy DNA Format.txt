DoS Enemy DNA (36 bytes long):
Bytes 1-4: Pointer to enemy create code.
Bytes 5-8: Pointer to enemy update code.
Bytes 9-10: Item1. Global ID+1 of the item.
Byte 11-12: Item2.
Byte 13: Palette offset to use when this enemy is petrified.
Byte 14: Unknown.
  Ranges from 1 (for Zombie) to 99 decimal (for Dracula). As you scroll down the list of enemies this value only gets bigger or stays the same, never smaller.
Bytes 15-16: Max HP.
Bytes 17-18: Max MP.
Bytes 19-20: EXP.
Byte 21: Chance to drop its soul.
  00 is a guaranteed drop, but after that it scales from 01 (rare) to FF (very common, but not guaranteed).
  The formula for calculating soul drop chance is as follows:
    this_number / (512 - luck/8)
  So, if the player has 0 luck, and an enemy has 8 for this number, the chance to get its soul is:
    8 / (512 - 0/8) = 1.56%
  If the player has 99 luck instead, and the enemy still has 8 for this number, the chance to get its soul is:
    8 / (512 - 99/8) = 1.60%
  Yes, luck has almost no effect on soul drop chances.
  The Soul Eater Ring basically doubles the drop chance, the formula is:
    (this_number*2 + 0.125) / (512 - luck/8)
  On hard mode, luck has 4x the effect on soul/item chances.
Byte 22: Attack stat.
Byte 23: Defense stat.
  Doubles as both physical and magical defense.
Byte 24: Chance to drop an item.
  The formula for calculating item drop chance is as follows:
    (this_number*3) / (1024 - luck)
  So, if the player has 0 luck, and an enemy has 8 for this number, the chance to get its item 1 is:
    (8*3) / (1024 - 0) = 2.34%
  If the player has 99 luck instead, and the enemy still has 8 for this number, the chance to get its item 1 is:
    (8*3) / (1024 - 99) = 2.59%
  So luck has more effect on item drops than soul drops, but the effect is still very small.
  The Rare Ring doubles the drop chance, the formula is:
    (this_number*3*2) / (1024 - luck)
  Once it's been decided that you're going to get an item drop, it then decides whether you'll get Item1 or Item2.
  If the enemy has only an Item1, Item1 will drop.
  If the enemy has an Item2, the chance of the drop being the rarer Item2 is:
    256 / (1024 - luck)
  The Rare Ring also doubles that chance.
  If that Item2 chance fails, Item1 will drop. Or nothing will drop if the enemy has no Item1.
  On hard mode, luck has 4x the effect on soul/item chances.
