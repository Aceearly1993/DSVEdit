Map tile metadata (DoS):
Each map tile is 2 bytes long. Unlike PoR and OoE, every map tile, even completely blank ones, have an entry here.
When these 2 bytes are equal to FFFF the tile has no fill color, only its lines (if any) are drawn.
Bytes 1-2:
Most significant bit first.
  Bit 1: is a save room (red) (takes precedence over blue)
  Bit 2: is a warp room (blue)
  Bits 3-6: unused
  Bits 7-10: Sector index of the room located here. This also affects the music, as music is tied to the sector. Also seems to affect where doors will lead you? Also used by the suspend function to remember what room you suspended in.
  Bits 11-16: Room index of the room located here. Unlike PoR and OoE, warp rooms don't seem to use this to decide what room to place the player in. Used by the suspend function to remember what sector you suspended in.

Map tile line data (DoS):
Each map tile takes up only half a byte.
Most significant bit first.
  Bit 1: has top door
  Bit 2: has top ceiling
  Bit 3: has left door
  Bit 4: has left wall

Map tile metadata (PoR and OoE):
Bytes 1-2: control type of room.
Most significant bit first.
  Bit 1: is a save room (red).
  Bit 2: is a warp room (blue).
  Bit 3: is a secret room
  Bit 4: is transition room (no special color, but loads necessary tile data for rooms around it automatically).
  Bit 5: is an area entrance (yellow).
  Bit 6: unused
  Bits 7-10: Sector index of the room located here. This also affects the music, as music is tied to the area/sector.
  Bits 11-16: Room index of the room located here. Used by warp room and area entrance to decide where to place the player.
Byte 3: y pos on map.
Byte 4: x pos on map.

Map tile line data (PoR and OoE):
Each tile on the map takes up 1 byte.
Most significant bit first.
  Bit 1: has bottom door (overrides bit 2)
  Bit 2: has bottom floor
  Bit 3: has right door (overrides bit 4)
  Bit 4: has right wall
  Bit 5: has top door (overrides bit 6)
  Bit 6: has top ceiling
  Bit 7: has left door (overrides bit 8)
  Bit 8: has left wall

Map length in tiles (PoR and OoE):
Each entry is 2 bytes long. It's simply the number of map tiles that this map has, so you know when to stop reading map tiles.
