Tileset:
Each block in the tileset is 4 bytes long.
Starts from the first real tile, not the blank tile.
Bits   1-6: Index of the tile on the tile page.
Bits  7-12: Seems unused.
Bits 13-17: Tile page index.
Bit     18: Horizontal flip.
Bit     19: Vertical flip.
Bits 20-24: Seems unused.
Bits 25-32: Palette index.

Collision tileset:
Each block in the tileset is 4 bytes long.
Starts from the first real tile, not the blank tile.
Byte 1: The collision of this tile. See Tile collision values.
Byte 2: 00
Byte 3: 0B
Byte 4: 3C

Tile collision values:
Bitfield. Least significant bit first.
Bits 1-4: Varies depending on whether this tile is a slope or not. See Tile collision values for slopes/non-slopes.
Bit 5:
Bit 6:
Bit 7: Slope TODO
Bit 8:

Tile collision values for non-slopes:
Least significant bit first.
Bit 1: Platform you can jump up through. Combine with bit 2 to get a fully solid block.
Bit 2: Solid bottom, left, and right, but top pushes you downwards and out to either the left or right.
Bit 3: Damage
Bit 4: Water

Tile collision values for slopes:
Least significant bit first.
Bit 1: Must be 1 for the slope to be solid, otherwise it acts as an air block.
Bit 2: Floor slope when 0, ceiling slope when 1.
Bit 3: When 0, slopes from top left to bottom right. When 1, slopes from bottom left to top right.
Bit 4: Nothing.

1000
1010
0100 - Normal slope.
1100 - 4-part slope, highest part.
1101 - 4-part slope, higher-middle part.
1110 - 4-part slope, lower-middle part.
1111 - 4-part slope, lowest part.

00110011 - Half-height solid block.
