    Least significant bit first.
    Bit 1: 
    Bit 3: Has some effect on damage. Doesn't actually affect atk/str stats though. RPG has this bit set. Since RPG is known to do damage independent of Soma's stats, that's probably what's happening here.

    Bit 2: Weapon doesn't follow Soma, it floats in the air where Soma started swinging it.
    Bit 3:

    Bit 7: Makes weapon transparent.

    Bit 9: Weapon doesn't stop swinging when Soma's swinging animation ends. Only seems to do anything if combined with bit 5.
