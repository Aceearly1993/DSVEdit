Example: /jnt/j_dem.jnt in OoE.

Bytes 00-01: 01 23
Byte 02: 08 or 0B or 0C or 0D
Bytes 03-1F: Filename starting with "p_" and having the file extension ".opd". For example, "p_dem00.opd". This may have been the skeleton file's original filename.
Byte 20: 00
Byte 21: 00
Bytes 22-23: X offset in pixels for the skeleton to be drawn at relative to the enemy's x pos. (Signed.)
Bytes 24-25: Y offset in pixels for the skeleton to be drawn at relative to the enemy's y pos. (Signed.)
Byte 26: Number of joints (includes both visible and invisible joints).
Byte 27: Number of invisible joints.
Byte 28: Number of visible joints.
Byte 29: Number of hitboxes.
Byte 2A: number of poses.
Byte 2B: Number of points.
Byte 2C: Number of animations.
Byte 2D: 00
Byte 2E: 00
Byte 2F: 00
Bytes 30+: See below.

List of joints:
Each is 4 bytes long. 
  Byte 1: Parent joint ID.
  Byte 2: Frame ID to use. If this is FF, it's not actually a frame, it's just a dummy invisible joint.
  Byte 3: Bitfield.
    Least significant bit first.
    Bits 1-2: Positional rotation of this joint around its parent. In 90 degree intervals, so 1 = 90, 2 = 180, 3 = 270.
    Bit 3: Whether this joint inherits the rotation of its parent.
    Bit 4: Horizontally flip this joint, visually.
    Bit 5: Vertically flip this joint, visually.
    Bits 6-8: ?
  Byte 4: Palette index.
    Might override part's palette index? TODO

List of poses:
  Byte 1: Joint ID for something? FF means the next byte is ignored.
  Byte 2: Distance in pixels to offset this pose upwards?
  Then a list of each joint change in this pose. These joints are in the same order as in the list of joints.
  Each joint change is 4 bytes long:
    Bytes 1-2: Rotation. Every 0x4000 corresponds to 90 degrees.
    Byte 3: Distance in pixels to position this part relative to the part its connected to. (Signed.)
    Byte 4: ID of the frame to replace this joint's frame with. FF means don't replace it, keep it at what it was before.

List of hitboxes:
Each is 8 bytes long.
  Bytes 1-2: Rotation. (Signed.)
  Byte 3: Distance in pixels. (Unsigned, unlike distance for joint changes.)
  Byte 4: Width in pixels.
  Byte 5: Height in pixels.
  Byte 6: Corresponding joint ID.
  Byte 7: Bitfield.
    Least significant bit first.
    Bit 1: Can deal damage.
    Bit 2: Can take damage.
    Bits 3-8: Unused?
  Byte 8: 00?

List of points:
Each is 4 bytes long.
  Bytes 1-2: Rotation. (Signed.)
  Byte 3: Distance in pixels. (Unsigned, unlike distance for joint changes.)
  Byte 4: Corresponding joint ID.

List of joint IDs by draw order:
Each is 1 byte long. The number of these is the same as the number of visible joints.
  Byte 1: The ID of the joint to draw.

List of animations:
Each is 1 + (3*number of keyframes) bytes long.
  Byte 1: Number of keyframes.
  Each keyframe:
    Byte 1: The pose to use.
    Byte 2: The number of frames to ease into this keyframe.
    Byte 3: 0 1 2 3 TODO
