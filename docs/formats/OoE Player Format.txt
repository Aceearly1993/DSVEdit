      All damage will be exactly halved. There's no minimum of 1 damage here, so 1 damage gets halved to 0.

  48,
  4C,4: Pointer to list of hitbox pointers.
  50,2: Height in pixels.
    This is negative because it's the offset off the floor the player extends.
    This if for collision checking with tiles, not enemies.
  52,2: Which player face icon to use. This is a frame index in the common sprite.
    This seems unused in OoE, and is just leftover from PoR.

    This points to a list of pointers, one for each swing animation type (specified in the item data for the glyph).

      In order: Attacking standing, attacking crouched, attacking in air, finish attacking standing, finish attacking crouched.
  58,4: Pointer to list of swing animations for X-button glyphs. Works the same as above.
