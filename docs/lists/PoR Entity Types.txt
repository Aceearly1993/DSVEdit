    Var B: The local ID of the skill.

05 Nothing? Unused?

06 Pickup that only appears once all quests have been completed.
  Subtype/Var A/Var B work the same as normal pickups.
  The only other difference from normal pickups is that this pickup won't appear if you already own at least one of the pickup.
  
07 Pickup hidden inside a breakable wall.
  Subtype/Var A/Var B work the same as normal pickups.
  This should be placed together with special object 3B. Their positions don't need to be exactly the same, but close.
  If not placed inside a breakable wall, this just acts like a normal pickup not hidden inside a wall.

  Byte 8: Low nibble is the number of entities after this one to skip. If 0, all remaining entities are skipped.
