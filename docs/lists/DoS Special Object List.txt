  11-17 More candle graphics, including statues and grandfather clocks.
  18-FF Buggy candles, that have mismatched graphics, sfx, and contents, or they just don't show up at all.

  If you use paranoia to enter the mirror for a room that isn't set up to support mirrors, the screen just stays white and doesn't fade out (though a cutscene can fade it out). You can't exit the mirror using paranoia. You can't exit the room via the doors. Also, the doors don't block you from moving like they would in a normal mirror room - presumably some special object or tiles need to be set up to block the door.

19 Bloody spike that spins around. Spinning speed controlled by var b.
1A Like 19, but the actual spike is broken off so it can't hurt you.
