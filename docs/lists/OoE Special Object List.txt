  Var B is the flag for whether you've opened this chest yet or not.
17 Blue chest.
  Hidden in the floor, you must stand over it and crouch to reveal it.
  Var A and var B work like red/gold chests.

27 Iron maiden trap.

  Byte 5: Which waypoints are for this platform? (See below.) This should match all of the waypoints byte 5s.
  Var A: Sprite animation to use.
  Var B: Speed to move.
2A Moving platform waypoint.
  Object 29 will seek out its waypoints and move to them one at a time (in the order the waypoints were placed in the room), and then go back to its starting position and repeat the process.
  Byte 5: Which platform is this waypoint for? This should match the platform's byte 5.
2B Area exit. touching it puts you back on the world map. extends infinitely vertically. also draws the arrows pointing out.

    Low byte: The room index of the house to go into.

  Var B: Y pos to enter the room at.
2D Wooden door inside houses in Wygol.

31 Moving spike thing from Training Chamber. Changes with var a:
  00 Moves horizontally
  01 Like 01 but bloody
  02 Moves vertically
  03 Like 02 but bloody
  04 Doesn't move
  Var b is the speed it moves at. It's very precise - small values will make it look like it's not moving at all, so it's best to change the high byte. When var b is 0 it just uses a default speed, which is about equal to setting var b to 0x1000 manually.
32 Falling boulder.
33 Falling boulder.
34 Warp point.
  Var A: Affects the background reflected in the floating water. Can be 00-0A.

  Var B: Speed in subpixels per frame for the clouds to move left.
38 Waves in the background of Kalidus Channel.
  Requires overlay 46.
39 Water level.
  Var A: Vertical distance in pixels for the waves to move the water level up or down. For example, a value of 0x20 means at its highest point the water level will be 2 blocks above the position you placed it at, and at its lowest point the water level will be 2 blocks below the position you placed it at. 0 means the water level does not move up or down.
  Var B: If Var A is 0, this is the z-index for the water level to be drawn on.
    Otherwise, it's the speed for the water level to move up and down at. This is relative to the total distance the water level needs to travel, so for larger values of Var A the water level will move faster even if Var B is the same.

3B Pneuma glyph and the wind puzzle around it.
  Requires overlay 55.
