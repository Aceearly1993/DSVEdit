Special Objects:
00 Nothing.
01 Magnes grapple point.
02 Destructible.
  When var A is 00 it's a statue that yields a glyph when destroyed. Var B controls what glyph it is, it's the global ID of the glyph + 1.
  When var A is 01 to 1E, it's a candle.
  When var A is 1F or higher, it looks like a glyph statue but has a messed up palette, and it may yield either a glyph or money like a candle.
03 Unused and no apparent effect.
04 large block with spikes on its right side that shanoa can push. part of an unused puzzle?
05 Stone block that shanoa can push and it breaks if it falls.

  Var A is which door, 0 being the leftmost and 3 being the rightmost.
0F Nothing? Appears in unused Wygol Village room. Like 0D and 0E, there are 4 of these corresponding to the 4 doors, but removing 0F doesn't make the door disappear.
10 adds the boss rush timer to the screen. timer doesn't go away. reentering the room restarts the timer.
11 Boss rush portal that takes you to the next boss. Doesn't appear unless the boss rush timer is on screen. Crashes when you enter it.
12 Crash. Used in final room of boss rush that gives you the prize.
13 Pot of infinite big hearts.
14 Row of spikes.
  Var A is the style of spikes:
    00 Normal floor spikes (Lighthouse)
    04 Stone floor spikes (Tymeo Mountains)
    08 Metal floor spikes (Mechanical Tower)
    09 Metal left wall spikes
    0A Metal ceiling spikes (Mechanical Tower)
    0C Ice floor spikes (Tristis Pass)
    10 Spiked balls (Training Chamber)
  Var B is the number of blocks wide the spikes span.
15 Wooden/green chest. Var A controls the item in it?
16 Red chest.
  Var A controls what item is inside it, it's the global ID of the item + 1. 0 means the chest won't appear. If you put a glyph in the chest nothing will appear when you open it.
  Var B is the ID the game uses to keep track of whether you've opened this chest yet or not.
17 Blue chest. Hidden in the floor, you must stand over it and crouch to reveal it. Var A and var B work like red chests.
18 Does several strange things, overwrites the entities for this room in ram (with level data maybe?) and lags the emulator so much it almost seems frozen
19 Part of the waterfall in Tristis pass. This object is responsible for making it impossible for Shanoa to jump up the waterfall, and making bubbles appear around Shanoa when she is inside it.
1A Movement blocker. The area covered by this object will act impassable, both to Shanoa in human form and in Paries form.
  Var A: Width of the area.
  Var B: Height of the area.
1B Same as 1C?
1C Background shadow for Shanoa. Var A is the z-index of the shadow (can make the shadow go on top of Shanoa with this). Var B affects what layer the shadow is constrained onto (TODO: figure out specifics).
1D 
1E Fog near the ground.
1F crash
20 The ring of flaming heads with a magnes point in the center from the training hall. Var b is the speed it rotates at.
21
22 
23 hard crash
24 
25 crash
26 Rat running around.
27 hard crash
28 crash
29 Bloody platform.
2A 
2B Area exit. touching it puts you back on the world map. extends infinitely vertically. also draws the arrows pointing out.
2C Wygol door that leads into a house. Vars A and B both do something - they seem to affect the x/y position Shanoa will appear in the house.
2D crash
2E Wooden door.
2F Screen goes black and music cuts out, and you lose control of Shanoa. Game doesn't crash as you can still see the top screen map blinking.
30 Small block that crumbles after Shanoa stands on it for a second.
31 Moving spike thing from training hall. Changes with var a:
  00 Moves horizontally
  01 Like 01 but bloody
  02 Moves vertically
  03 Like 02 but bloody
  04 Doesn't move
  Var b is the speed it moves at. It's very precise - small values will make it look like it's not moving at all, so it's best to change the high byte. When var b is 0 it just uses a default speed, which is about equal to setting var b to 0x1000 manually.
32 Falling boulder.
33 Falling boulder.
34 Warp point. Var A does... something?
35 
36 Bubbles come out of Shanoa's mouth as if she was underwater.

  If var A is 0 the searchlights are on. If it's 1 they're off.
  If var A is 1 and the Giant Skeleton isn't dead yet then the searchlights take control away from the player and wait for the Giant Skeleton to do its thing (if he's not in the room the game will softlock).
  TODO: look into how enemies are spawned by searchlights.
3F Cat. Var a controls which cat it is.
40 The falling block puzzle from the monastery.
41 Object that floats (supposed to be in the water). Var a changes what it is:
  00 Log platform
  01 Crate platform
  02 Red ball
  03 Rubber ducky
  04+ Log, but unlike 00 it doesn't bob up and down and you can't use it as a platform.
42 A trap from Minera Prison Island.
  When var A is 0, it's a guillotine. Var B is the delay in frames between each time it comes down.
  When var A is greater than 0, it's a swinging axe. Var A controls the length of the axe's chain. Var B is the speed at which it swings.
43 crash
44 Lapiste glyph and the boulder trap that comes with it.
45 crash
46 Save point. Obeys the x pos you set but ignores the y pos. Instead it decides its y pos by placing itself on the highest point of solid ground at the given x pos (excluding the ceiling).
